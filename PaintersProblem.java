// We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. There are k painters available 
// and each takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of the board. The problem is to 
// find the minimum time to get this job was done under the constraints that 
// any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, say board {2, 3, 4} 
// or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.
// Input : k = 2, A = {10, 10, 10, 10} 
// Output : 20
// Explanation: Here we can divide the boards into 2 equal sized 
// partitions, so each painter gets 20 units of board and the total time taken is 20. 

// Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40} 
// Output : 60
// Explanation: Here we can divide first 3 boards for one painter 
// and the last board for second painter.
